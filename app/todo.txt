- footer
- Add feature for blog post/updates
- Maybe deal with the manual delay at the beginning of every page or use actual loading screen?
- Make sure accessKey gets deleted
- get data from ESPN or enter picks via team name
- Let people edit picks with access key (Will have to work at how Ember models work again)
- Let me edit names along with everything else in the admin goodies screen OR first/last name fields
- blog post feature could still be dope
- Fix the horrible error message when people don't select a conference
- Floating question mark for description of goodie pick
